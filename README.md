# Hippo CMS demo | Docker image

Demo with [HippoCMS](http://www.onehippo.org/) running sample GoGreen website. Based on [article from Hippo Labs](http://www.onehippo.org/labs/creating-a-docker-container-for-hippo-cms.html).

Caveat: this is not in any way a production setup, it's just a demo to quickly try Hippo CMS Community Edition.

## Usage

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 million12/hippocms
```

and then access the site on http://DOCKER_IP:8080/
